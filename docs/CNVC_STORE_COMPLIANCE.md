## Notes

- CNVC operates a "virtual" store - they list products with purchase links, not direct sales
- This is mutually beneficial: we get visibility, CNVC gets affiliate income
- Cindy Zody's connection to NVC community may help with approval
- Consider reaching out to CNVC before formal submission to discuss partnership
