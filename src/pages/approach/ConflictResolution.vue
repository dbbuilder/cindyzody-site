        <h1>Conflict Resolution</h1>

        <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600">Moving from opposition to collaboration by listening for the needs beneath positions—discovering that most conflicts dissolve when both people feel genuinely heard.</p>

        <p>Conflict is inevitable. Two people with different experiences, needs, and perspectives will see things differently. The question isn't how to avoid conflict but how to navigate it in ways that strengthen rather than damage relationships. Effective conflict resolution doesn't mean someone wins and someone loses—it means finding paths forward that honor what matters most to everyone involved.</p>

        <p>Most conflicts escalate because people feel unheard. We dig into our positions, repeat ourselves louder, and stop listening to understand—we listen only to rebut. The breakthrough comes when we shift from arguing about who's right to exploring what each person needs. Beneath every position is a need, and needs are rarely in conflict even when positions seem irreconcilable.</p>

        <h2>The Approach</h2>

        <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 not-prose my-8">
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Deep Listening</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Truly hearing the other person—not just their words but their feelings and needs. Reflecting back what you understand until they feel fully received.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Need Identification</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Moving past positions ("I want X") to uncover underlying needs ("I need security/respect/connection"). Needs are universal and create common ground.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Creative Problem-Solving</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Once needs are clear, brainstorming solutions that might meet everyone's needs. Often, options emerge that neither party initially imagined.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Agreement Building</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Creating specific, doable agreements that both parties genuinely support—not grudging compromises but collaborative solutions.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p>Conflict resolution sessions might involve just you (preparing for or processing a conflict) or both parties together. When working alone, we explore your needs, practice expressing them clearly, and anticipate the other person's perspective. When working together, I facilitate a structured conversation that ensures both people are heard.</p>

        <p>The goal isn't to make conflict comfortable—it often isn't. The goal is to navigate conflict in ways that lead to understanding and solutions rather than escalation and damage.</p>

        <h2>Common Scenarios</h2>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-700 mb-2">The Recurring Argument</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">You and your partner keep having the same fight about household responsibilities. Beneath the surface issue, you discover different needs: one needs order to feel calm, the other needs flexibility to feel respected. Understanding this transforms the conversation.</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 italic">The shift: From "you always/never" to "we both need."</p>

            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">Two team members have incompatible ideas about how to proceed. Rather than the manager deciding, the team explores the needs each approach serves. A hybrid solution emerges that neither proposed but both support.</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 italic">The shift: From power struggle to collaborative design.</p>
