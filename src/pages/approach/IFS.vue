        <h1>Internal Family Systems (IFS)</h1>

        <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600">A compassionate approach that meets our inner parts with curiosity rather than judgment—discovering that even our most troublesome patterns are trying to help us.</p>

        <p>Internal Family Systems, developed by Dr. Richard Schwartz, offers a revolutionary way of understanding our inner world. Rather than seeing ourselves as having a single, unified personality, IFS recognizes that we all contain multiple "parts"—different aspects of ourselves that carry different feelings, beliefs, and roles. Some parts protect us, some carry old wounds, and at our core lives the Self: a centered, compassionate presence capable of healing.</p>

        <p>What makes IFS transformative is its non-pathologizing stance. That inner critic isn't your enemy—it's a part trying to protect you from rejection. The anxiety that grips you before big moments? A part working overtime to keep you safe. When we approach these parts with curiosity instead of trying to eliminate them, something remarkable happens: they relax, and deeper healing becomes possible.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Parts</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">The different sub-personalities within us, each with its own feelings, thoughts, and protective strategies. All parts have positive intentions, even when their methods cause problems.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Self</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">The core of who we are—characterized by qualities like curiosity, compassion, calm, clarity, and confidence. The Self can't be damaged and is always available to lead our inner system.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Unburdening</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">The healing process where parts release the extreme beliefs and emotions they've carried, often since childhood. Parts are freed to take on new, healthier roles.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p>IFS-informed sessions are gentle explorations of your inner landscape. We might notice a feeling arising and get curious about it: "What part of you feels that way? What is it trying to protect you from?" There's no forcing, no rushing. Parts reveal themselves when they feel safe, and healing happens at its own pace.</p>

        <p>You don't need to believe in "parts" for this work to help. Many people find that the language simply gives them a useful way to understand their inner conflicts—why part of them wants one thing while another part wants something completely different.</p>

        <h2>Common Scenarios</h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 my-8">
          <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 border border-slate-200 shadow-sm">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-700 mb-2">The Inner Critic</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">You notice harsh self-judgment after a mistake. Instead of trying to silence it, you get curious: "What is this critical part trying to protect me from?" Often, you discover a part that learned early that criticism from yourself hurts less than criticism from others.</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 italic">The shift: From self-attack to self-understanding.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 border border-slate-200 shadow-sm">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-700 mb-2">The Procrastinator</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">A part keeps avoiding an important task. Rather than forcing action, you ask: "What are you afraid will happen if I do this?" The part might reveal fear of failure, fear of success, or protection of a younger part that got overwhelmed by expectations.</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 italic">The shift: From willpower battle to compassionate dialogue.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 border border-slate-200 shadow-sm">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-700 mb-2">The People-Pleaser</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">You notice yourself saying yes when you mean no. Exploring this part reveals its role: keeping you safe by ensuring others' approval. With compassion, you can help this part trust that your Self can handle occasional disapproval.</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 italic">The shift: From automatic compliance to conscious choice.</p>
