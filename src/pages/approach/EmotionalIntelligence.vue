        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

        <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600">The capacity to recognize, understand, and skillfully navigate emotions—our own and others'—is the foundation of every meaningful relationship and effective interaction.</p>

        <p>Emotional Intelligence (EI) isn't about suppressing feelings or always staying calm. It's about developing a nuanced awareness of the emotional currents flowing through our lives and learning to work with them rather than against them. When we strengthen this capacity, we make better decisions, communicate more effectively, and build deeper connections with the people who matter most.</p>

        <p>Research consistently shows that emotional intelligence predicts success in relationships, leadership, and personal well-being more reliably than IQ alone. The good news is that unlike cognitive intelligence, EI can be developed at any age through intentional practice and guided support.</p>
