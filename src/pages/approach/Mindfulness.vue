        <h1>Mindfulness</h1>

        <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600">The practice of present-moment awareness that stabilizes attention and supports nervous-system regulation—creating space between stimulus and response.</p>

        <p>Mindfulness is deceptively simple: paying attention to the present moment without judgment. Yet this simple practice has profound effects on how we experience life and relate to others. When we're mindful, we're not lost in regrets about the past or anxieties about the future. We're here, now, able to respond to what's actually happening rather than reacting to our stories about it.</p>

        <p>For emotional intelligence and communication, mindfulness is essential. It creates the pause that allows us to choose our response. Without that pause, we're on autopilot—running old patterns, saying things we regret, missing what's actually being communicated. With practice, mindfulness becomes not just something we do but a way we live.</p>

        <h2>Core Elements</h2>

        <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 not-prose my-8">
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Attention Stabilization</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Training the mind to stay present rather than constantly wandering. Like building a muscle, we strengthen our capacity to focus where we choose.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Non-Judgmental Awareness</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Observing our experience without labeling it good or bad. This reduces the secondary suffering we create by fighting against what is.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Nervous System Regulation</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Using breath and body awareness to shift from fight-or-flight activation to a calmer, more resourced state where clear thinking is possible.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Embodied Presence</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Coming out of the thinking mind and into the felt sense of being in a body. This grounds us and provides valuable information about our emotional state.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p>Mindfulness isn't about emptying your mind or achieving bliss. In sessions, we practice accessible techniques you can use anywhere: brief pauses before responding, breath awareness during difficult moments, body scans to check in with yourself. These aren't add-ons to your busy life—they're woven into the moments you're already living.</p>

        <p>We also explore what gets in the way of presence. What pulls you out of the moment? What thoughts hook you? Understanding your patterns helps you return to presence more quickly when you notice you've wandered.</p>

        <h2>Common Scenarios</h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 my-8">
          <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 border border-slate-200 shadow-sm">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-700 mb-2">The Heated Moment</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">An argument is escalating. You notice your heart racing, jaw tightening. Instead of saying the next thing that comes to mind, you take one conscious breath. In that small pause, you choose a different response—or choose to take a break.</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 italic">The shift: From reactive explosion to conscious choice.</p>
          </div>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-brand-700 mb-2">The Anxious Mind</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">Worry thoughts are spiraling about tomorrow's presentation. You notice you're not here—you're in an imagined future. Gently, you bring attention to your feet on the floor, the sounds in the room. The future fades; the present emerges.</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 italic">The shift: From future-tripping to grounded presence.</p>
          </div>

            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">You're listening to someone share something painful. Rather than planning your response or trying to fix it, you practice simply being present with them. Your full attention becomes a gift that helps them feel truly heard.</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 italic">The shift: From doing to being with.</p>
