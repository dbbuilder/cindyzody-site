        <h1>Attitudinal Healing</h1>

        <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600">A practice of shifting from fear-based reactions to love-centered choices—recognizing that we can choose peace regardless of external circumstances.</p>

        <p>Attitudinal Healing, developed by Dr. Jerry Jampolsky and inspired by A Course in Miracles, rests on a simple premise: our attitudes—not our circumstances—determine our experience. When we change how we see a situation, the situation itself transforms. This isn't positive thinking or denial; it's a profound recognition that we have more choice than we realize.</p>

        <p>At its core, Attitudinal Healing distinguishes between two fundamental emotional states: love and fear. Every thought, every reaction, every choice stems from one or the other. When we're in fear, we attack, defend, judge, and separate. When we're in love, we connect, forgive, understand, and heal. The practice is learning to recognize which state we're in and choosing to shift toward love.</p>

        <h2>The Twelve Principles</h2>

          <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Attitudinal Healing is guided by twelve principles, including:</p>

              <span class="text-brand-600 font-bold">•</span>

              <span class="text-brand-600 font-bold">•</span>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p>In sessions drawing from Attitudinal Healing, we examine the attitudes and beliefs underlying your struggles. Often, we discover fear-based thinking that feels so natural we don't recognize it as a choice. Together, we explore what it would mean to see the situation differently—not to excuse harmful behavior, but to free yourself from the prison of resentment and reactivity.</p>

        <p>This work often involves forgiveness—not as condoning what happened, but as releasing its hold on you. We also practice catching ourselves in fear-based thinking and gently choosing again.</p>

            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">You've been holding onto anger about something someone did years ago. It still burns when you think about it. Through Attitudinal Healing, you explore: "What would it mean to release this? What am I afraid would happen if I forgave?" Often, we discover we've confused forgiveness with approval.</p>

            <p class="text-slate-600 mb-3">Traffic, a coworker's habits, the news—small things keep triggering anger or anxiety. You begin to notice: "I'm choosing to see this as an attack on my peace." With practice, you catch yourself earlier and ask: "Is there another way to see this?"</p>
