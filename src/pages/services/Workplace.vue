        <h1>Workplace Facilitation</h1>

        <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600">Building psychological safety, feedback culture, and effective communication within teams and organizations through values-based facilitation.</p>

        <p>Workplace relationships shape our daily experience more than almost anything else. When teams communicate well—when people feel safe to share ideas, give honest feedback, and address conflicts directly—creativity flourishes and burnout decreases. When communication breaks down, the best strategy can't save you.</p>

        <p>I bring the principles of Non-Violent Communication and emotional intelligence into organizational settings, adapting the language and approach to fit workplace culture while maintaining the core focus on needs, clarity, and connection.</p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>

        <p>Every engagement begins with understanding your specific context—the culture, the challenges, the history, and the goals. From there, I design an approach that fits your organization, which might include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Initial assessment through interviews and observation</li>
          <li>Custom workshop design tailored to your challenges</li>
          <li>Ongoing coaching for leaders and teams</li>
          <li>Facilitation of difficult conversations as needed</li>
          <li>Tools and frameworks your team can use independently</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The goal is always to build internal capacity—not dependence on outside facilitation. I aim to teach skills and create structures that your organization can sustain long after our engagement ends.</p>
