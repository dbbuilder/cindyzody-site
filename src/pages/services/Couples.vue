        <h1>Couples & Family Sessions</h1>

        <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600">Facilitated dialogues to help partners and family members hear one another's needs, make clear requests, and co-design agreements for healthier relationships.</p>

        <p>When two or more people come together with a skilled facilitator, transformation becomes possible. These sessions create space for each person to be fully heard while building skills for ongoing connection. Whether you're navigating a specific conflict, rebuilding trust, or simply wanting to deepen your relationship, we work together toward mutual understanding.</p>

        <p>Unlike traditional couples therapy that focuses on diagnosis and treatment, this approach treats you as capable people who want to connect better. We focus on building practical skills—empathic listening, clear expression, and collaborative problem-solving—that you can use long after our sessions end.</p>

        <h2>How Sessions Work</h2>

        <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 not-prose my-8">
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Structured Dialogue</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">I facilitate a structured conversation where each person speaks and is reflected back until they feel fully understood. This often reveals that beneath disagreement, both people want similar things.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Need Translation</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">I help translate complaints and criticisms into the underlying needs. "You never listen to me" becomes "I need to feel that what I say matters to you."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Request Crafting</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">Together we transform vague wants into specific, doable requests that the other person can say yes or no to—creating clarity rather than assumptions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sage-50 rounded-xl p-6 border border-sage-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900 mb-3">Agreement Building</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-600">When both people feel heard, we collaboratively design agreements that honor everyone's needs—not compromises where everyone loses, but creative solutions.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>

        <p>Most couples and families see meaningful progress within 4-8 sessions, though some choose ongoing support. The first session focuses on understanding what each person wants and establishing safety. From there, we dive into the work—always at a pace that respects everyone's readiness.</p>

        <p>Between sessions, you'll practice the skills we develop together. Real change happens in daily life, not just in our meetings. I provide specific practices and frameworks to support your continued growth.</p>
