        <h1>Individual Coaching</h1>

        <p class="lead text-xl text-slate-600">One-on-one sessions focused on building emotional literacy, self-compassion, and choicefulness using NVC, IFS-informed approaches, and mindfulness practices.</p>

        <p>Individual coaching creates a safe, confidential space to explore your inner world, develop new communication skills, and work through specific challenges in your relationships and life. Whether you're preparing for a difficult conversation, processing a conflict, or simply wanting to grow in emotional intelligence, these sessions are tailored to your unique needs and pace.</p>

        <p>Sessions integrate Non-Violent Communication (NVC), Internal Family Systems (IFS)-informed work, and mindfulness practices. We'll work with whatever is most alive for you—sometimes that means skill-building, sometimes it means compassionate exploration of your inner parts, and sometimes it means practicing for real conversations you're facing.</p>

        <h2>Session Structure</h2>

        <p>Sessions are 60 minutes and typically follow a flexible structure:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check-in (5-10 min):</strong> What's alive for you today? What do you want from our time together?</li>
          <li><strong>Core work (40-45 min):</strong> Skill practice, exploration, processing—tailored to your goals</li>
          <li><strong>Integration (5-10 min):</strong> Key takeaways, practices to try, next steps</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Most clients begin with weekly sessions, then transition to biweekly or monthly as skills develop. There's no minimum commitment—we work at the pace that serves you best.</p>
