      <h1>Approach</h1>
      <p><strong>Nonviolent Communication (NVC)</strong> centers universal human needs and clear requests. <strong>Internal Family Systems (IFS-informed)</strong> warmly meets parts with curiosity. <strong>Mindfulness</strong> stabilizes attention and nervous-system regulation. I also draw from <strong>Attitudinal Healing</strong> to shift from fear to love in daily choices.</p>
      <p>Sessions are practical, gentle, and skills-focused: we practice reflective listening, needs/feelings translation, and request-making, then we integrate actions at a sustainable pace.</p>
